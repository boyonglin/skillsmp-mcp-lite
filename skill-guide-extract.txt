and document creation. For those building MCP integrations, skills add another
powerful layer helping turn raw tool access into reliable, optimized workflows.
This guide covers everything you need to know to build effective skills - from
planning and structure to testing and distribution. Whether you're building a
skill for yourself, your team, or for the community, you'll find practical patterns
and real-world examples throughout.
What you'll learn:
• Technical requirements and best practices for skill structure
• Patterns for standalone skills and MCP-enhanced workflows
• Patterns we've seen work well across different use cases
• How to test, iterate, and distribute your skills
Who this is for:
• Developers who want Claude to follow specific workflows consistently

Fundamentals
What is a skill? Composability
A skill is a folder containing: Claude can load multiple skills simultaneously. Your skill should work well
alongside others, not assume it's the only capability available.
• SKILL.md (required): Instructions in Markdown with YAML frontmatter
• scripts/ (optional): Executable code (Python, Bash, etc.) Portability
• references/ (optional): Documentation loaded as needed
Skills work identically across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API. Create a skill once
• assets/ (optional): Templates, fonts, icons used in output and it works across all surfaces without modification, provided the environment
supports any dependencies the skill requires.

already know, so Claude can apply them consistently.
• Second level (SKILL.md body): Loaded when Claude thinks the skill is
relevant to the current task. Contains the full instructions and guidance.
The kitchen analogy
• Third level (Linked files): Additional files bundled within the skill directory
that Claude can choose to navigate and discover only as needed. MCP provides the professional kitchen: access to tools, ingredients, and
equipment.
This progressive disclosure minimizes token usage while maintaining
specialized expertise. Skills provide the recipes: step-by-step instructions on how to create something
valuable.

Together, they enable users to accomplish complex tasks without needing to
figure out every step themselves.

invocation
What Claude can do How Claude should do it
Why this matters for your MCP users
Without skills:
• Users connect your MCP but don't know what to do next
• Support tickets asking "how do I do X with your integration"
• Each conversation starts from scratch
• Inconsistent results because users prompt differently each time
• Users blame your connector when the real issue is workflow guidance
With skills:
• Pre-built workflows activate automatically when needed
• Consistent, reliable tool usage
• Best practices embedded in every interaction
• Lower learning curve for your integration

Chapter 2
Planning and design
Start with use cases Common skill use case categories
Before writing any code, identify 2-3 concrete use cases your skill should enable. At Anthropic, we’ve observed three common use cases:
Good use case definition: Category 1: Document & Asset Creation
Used for: Creating consistent, high-quality output including documents,
Use Case: Project Sprint Planning presentations, apps, designs, code, etc.
Trigger: User says "help me plan this sprint" or "create
sprint tasks" Real example: frontend-design skill (also see skills for docx, pptx, xlsx, and
Steps: ppt)
1. Fetch current project status from Linear (via MCP)
"Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design
2. Analyze team velocity and capacity
3. Suggest task prioritization quality. Use when building web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or
4. Create tasks in Linear with proper labels and estimates applications."
Result: Fully planned sprint with tasks created
Key techniques:
• Embedded style guides and brand standards
Ask yourself:
• Template structures for consistent output
• What does a user want to accomplish?
• Quality checklists before finalizing
• What multi-step workflows does this require?
• No external tools required - uses Claude's built-in capabilities
• Which tools are needed (built-in or MCP?)
• What domain knowledge or best practices should be embedded?

definition, frontmatter generation, instruction writing, and validation."
Quantitative metrics:
Key techniques:
• Skill triggers on 90% of relevant queries
• Step-by-step workflow with validation gates
– How to measure: Run 10-20 test queries that should trigger your skill. Track
• Templates for common structures
how many times it loads automatically vs. requires explicit invocation.
• Built-in review and improvement suggestions
• Completes workflow in X tool calls
• Iterative refinement loops – How to measure: Compare the same task with and without the skill enabled.
Count tool calls and total tokens consumed.
Category 3: MCP Enhancement
• 0 failed API calls per workflow
– How to measure: Monitor MCP server logs during test runs. Track retry rates
Used for: Workflow guidance to enhance the tool access an MCP server provides.
and error codes.
Real example: sentry-code-review skill (from Sentry)
Qualitative metrics:
"Automatically analyzes and fixes detected bugs in GitHub Pull Requests using
• Users don't need to prompt Claude about next steps
Sentry's error monitoring data via their MCP server."
– How to assess: During testing, note how often you need to redirect or clarify.
Ask beta users for feedback.
Key techniques:
• Coordinates multiple MCP calls in sequence
• Workflows complete without user correction
• Embeds domain expertise – How to assess: Run the same request 3-5 times. Compare outputs for
structural consistency and quality.
• Provides context users would otherwise need to specify
• Consistent results across sessions
• Error handling for common MCP issues
– How to assess: Can a new user accomplish the task on first try with minimal
guidance?

Chapter 3
Testing and iteration
Skills can be tested at varying levels of rigor depending on your needs: Recommended Testing Approach
• Manual testing in Claude.ai - Run queries directly and observe behavior. Fast
Based on early experience, effective skills testing typically covers three areas:
iteration, no setup required.
• Scripted testing in Claude Code - Automate test cases for repeatable 1. Triggering tests
validation across changes.
Goal: Ensure your skill loads at the right times.
• Programmatic testing via skills API - Build evaluation suites that run
systematically against defined test sets. Test cases:
Choose the approach that matches your quality requirements and the visibility • ✅ Triggers on obvious tasks
of your skill. A skill used internally by a small team has different testing needs • ✅ Triggers on paraphrased requests
than one deployed to thousands of enterprise users.
• ❌ Doesn't trigger on unrelated topics
Example test suite:
Pro Tip: Iterate on a single task before expanding
Should trigger:
We’ve found that the most effective skill creators iterate on a single challenging - "Help me set up a new ProjectHub workspace"
task until Claude succeeds, then extract the winning approach into a skill. This - "I need to create a project in ProjectHub"

- "What's the weather in San Francisco?"
- "Help me write Python code"
- "Create a spreadsheet" (unless ProjectHub skill handles
sheets)

2. Functional tests
With skill:
Goal: Verify the skill produces correct outputs. - Automatic workflow execution
- 2 clarifying questions only
Test cases:
- 0 failed API calls
• Valid outputs generated - 6,000 tokens consumed
• API calls succeed
• Error handling works
Using the skill-creator skill
• Edge cases covered
The skill-creator skill - available in Claude.ai via plugin directory or
Example:
download for Claude Code - can help you build and iterate on skills. If you
have an MCP server and know your top 2–3 workflows, you can build and test a

Then:
• Generate skills from natural language descriptions
- Project created in ProjectHub
- 5 tasks created with correct properties • Produce properly formatted SKILL.md with frontmatter
- All tasks linked to project
• Suggest trigger phrases and structure
- No API errors
Reviewing skills:
• Flag common issues (vague descriptions, missing triggers, structural

• Identify potential over/under-triggering risks
Goal: Prove the skill improves results vs. baseline.
• Suggest test cases based on the skill's stated purpose

Iteration based on feedback
Skills are living documents. Plan to iterate based on:
Undertriggering signals:
• Skill doesn't load when it should
• Users manually enabling it
• Support questions about when to use it
Solution: Add more detail and nuance to the description - this may include
keywords particularly for technical terms
Overtriggering signals:
• Skill loads for irrelevant queries
• Users disabling it
• Confusion about purpose
Solution: Add negative triggers, be more specific

Chapter 4
Distribution and sharing
Skills make your MCP integration more complete. As users compare connectors, Using skills via API
those with skills offer a faster path to value, giving you an edge over MCP-only
alternatives. For programmatic use cases - such as building applications, agents, or automated
workflows that leverage skills - the API provides direct control over skill
management and execution.
Current distribution model (January 2026)
Key capabilities:
How individual users get skills:
• `/v1/skills` endpoint for listing and managing skills
1. Download the skill folder
• Add skills to Messages API requests via the `container.skills` parameter
2. Zip the folder (if needed)
• Version control and management through the Claude Console
3. Upload to Claude.ai via Settings > Capabilities > Skills
• Works with the Claude Agent SDK for building custom agents
4. Or place in Claude Code skills directory
When to use skills via the API vs. Claude.ai:

to your MCP documentation that links to the skill, explains why using both
together is valuable, and provides a quick-start guide. Focus on outcomes, not features:
1. Host on GitHub ✅ Good:
– Public repo for open-source skills
– Clear README with installation instructions "The ProjectHub skill enables teams to set up complete project
– Example usage and screenshots workspaces in seconds — including pages, databases, and
templates — instead of spending 30 minutes on manual setup."
2. Document in Your MCP Repo
– Link to skills from MCP documentation
– Explain the value of using both together
❌ Bad:
– Provide quick-start guide
3. Create an Installation Guide
"The ProjectHub skill is a folder containing YAML frontmatter
and Markdown instructions that calls our MCP server tools."
-# Installing the [Your Service] skill
1. Download the skill:

Chapter 5
Patterns and troubleshooting
These patterns emerged from skills created by early adopters and internal teams. Pattern 1: Sequential workflow orchestration
They represent common approaches we've seen work well, not prescriptive
templates. Use when: Your users need multi-step processes in a specific order.
Example structure:
Choosing your approach: Problem-first vs. tool-first
Think of it like Home Depot. You might walk in with a problem - "I need to fix a -# Workflow: Onboard New Customer
kitchen cabinet" - and an employee points you to the right tools. Or you might
pick out a new drill and ask how to use it for your specific job. --# Step 1: Create Account
Call MCP tool: `create_customer`
Skills work the same way: Parameters: name, email, company
• Problem-first: "I need to set up a project workspace" → Your skill orchestrates
--# Step 2: Setup Payment
the right MCP calls in the right sequence. Users describe outcomes; the skill
Call MCP tool: `setup_payment_method`
handles the tools.
Wait for: payment method verification
• Tool-first: "I have Notion MCP connected" → Your skill teaches Claude the
optimal workflows and best practices. Users have access; the skill provides --# Step 3: Create Subscription
expertise. Call MCP tool: `create_subscription`
Parameters: plan_id, customer_id (from Step 1)
Most skills lean one direction. Knowing which framing fits your use case helps
you choose the right pattern below. --# Step 4: Send Welcome Email
Call MCP tool: `send_email`
Template: welcome_email_template
Key techniques:
• Explicit step ordering
• Dependencies between steps
• Validation at each stage
• Rollback instructions for failures
22

--- page 23 ---

Pattern 2: Multi-MCP coordination Pattern 3: Iterative refinement
Use when: Workflows span multiple services. Use when: Output quality improves with iteration.
Example: Design-to-development handoff Example: Report generation
--# Phase 1: Design Export (Figma MCP) -# Iterative Report Creation
1. Export design assets from Figma
2. Generate design specifications --# Initial Draft
3. Create asset manifest 1. Fetch data via MCP
2. Generate first draft report
--# Phase 2: Asset Storage (Drive MCP) 3. Save to temporary file
1. Create project folder in Drive
2. Upload all assets --# Quality Check
3. Generate shareable links 1. Run validation script: `scripts/check_report.py`
2. Identify issues:
--# Phase 3: Task Creation (Linear MCP) - Missing sections
1. Create development tasks - Inconsistent formatting
2. Attach asset links to tasks - Data validation errors
3. Assign to engineering team
--# Refinement Loop
--# Phase 4: Notification (Slack MCP) 1. Address each identified issue
1. Post handoff summary to #engineering 2. Regenerate affected sections
2. Include asset links and task references 3. Re-validate
4. Repeat until quality threshold met
Key techniques: --# Finalization
1. Apply final formatting
• Clear phase separation
2. Generate summary
• Data passing between MCPs 3. Save final version
• Validation before moving to next phase
• Centralized error handling Key techniques:
• Explicit quality criteria
• Iterative improvement
• Validation scripts
• Know when to stop iterating
23

--- page 24 ---

Pattern 4: Context-aware tool selection Pattern 5: Domain-specific intelligence
Use when: Same outcome, different tools depending on context. Use when: Your skill adds specialized knowledge beyond tool access.
Example: File storage Example: Financial compliance
-# Smart File Storage -# Payment Processing with Compliance
--# Decision Tree --# Before Processing (Compliance Check)
1. Check file type and size 1. Fetch transaction details via MCP
2. Determine best storage location: 2. Apply compliance rules:
- Large files (>10MB): Use cloud storage MCP - Check sanctions lists
- Collaborative docs: Use Notion/Docs MCP - Verify jurisdiction allowances
- Code files: Use GitHub MCP - Assess risk level
- Temporary files: Use local storage 3. Document compliance decision
--# Execute Storage --# Processing
Based on decision: IF compliance passed:
- Call appropriate MCP tool - Call payment processing MCP tool
- Apply service-specific metadata - Apply appropriate fraud checks
- Generate access link - Process transaction
ELSE:
--# Provide Context to User - Flag for review
Explain why that storage was chosen - Create compliance case
--# Audit Trail
Key techniques: - Log all compliance checks
- Record processing decisions
• Clear decision criteria
- Generate audit report
• Fallback options
• Transparency about choices
Key techniques:
• Domain expertise embedded in logic
• Compliance before action
• Comprehensive documentation
• Clear governance

Troubleshooting
# Wrong

Skill won't upload
Error: "Could not find SKILL.md in uploaded folder" # Correct
name: my-cool-skill
Cause: File not named exactly SKILL.md
Solution:
Skill doesn't trigger
• Rename to SKILL.md (case-sensitive)
• Verify with: ls -la should show SKILL.md Symptom: Skill never loads automatically
Error: "Invalid frontmatter" Fix:
Cause: YAML formatting issue Revise your description field. See The Description Field for good/bad examples.
Common mistakes: Quick checklist:

statistical modeling, regression, clustering. Do NOT use for
simple data exploration (use data-viz skill instead).
25

--- page 26 ---

2. Be more specific Instructions not followed
Symptom: Skill loads but Claude doesn't follow instructions
# Too broad
description: Processes documents
Common causes:
1. Instructions too verbose
# More specific
description: Processes PDF legal documents for contract review – Keep instructions concise
– Use bullet points and numbered lists
– Move detailed reference to separate files
3. Clarify scope
2. Instructions buried
– Put critical instructions at the top
description: PayFlow payment processing for e-commerce. Use – Use ## Important or ## Critical headers
specifically for online payment workflows, not for general
– Repeat key points if needed
financial queries.
3. Ambiguous language
# Bad
MCP connection issues
Make sure to validate things properly
Symptom: Skill loads but MCP calls fail
# Good
CRITICAL: Before calling create_project, verify:
Checklist:
- Project name is non-empty
1. Verify MCP server is connected - At least one team member assigned
– Claude.ai: Settings > Extensions > [Your Service] - Start date is not in the past
– Should show "Connected" status
Advanced technique: For critical validations, consider bundling a script
2. Check authentication
– API keys valid and not expired that performs the checks programmatically rather than relying on language
– Proper permissions/scopes granted instructions. Code is deterministic; language interpretation isn't. See the Office
– OAuth tokens refreshed skills for examples of this pattern.
4. Model "laziness" Add explicit encouragement:
3. Test MCP independently
– Ask Claude to call MCP directly (without skill)
– "Use [Service] MCP to fetch my projects" -# Performance Notes
– If this fails, issue is MCP not skill - Take your time to do this thoroughly
- Quality is more important than speed
4. Verify tool names
- Do not skip validation steps
– Skill references correct MCP tool names
– Check MCP server documentation
Note: Adding this to user prompts is more effective than in SKILL.md
– Tool names are case-sensitive
26

--- page 27 ---

Large context issues
Symptom: Skill seems slow or responses degraded
Causes:
• Skill content too large
• Too many skills enabled simultaneously
• All content loaded instead of progressive disclosure
Solutions:
1. Optimize SKILL.md size
– Move detailed docs to references/
– Link to references instead of inline
– Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words
2. Reduce enabled skills
– Evaluate if you have more than 20 - 50 skills enabled simultaneously
– Recommend selective enablement
– Consider skill "packs" for related capabilities
